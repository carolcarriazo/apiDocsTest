## Hi everyone!

I generated some test API documentation based on MongoDB's open source docs. This follows the OpenAPI framework and was built with a combination of Swagger and Redocly. For a demo of the site in production, contact me at carolcarriazo@gmail.com and I'm happy to show you through the project.

Thanks for looking!

Carolina
